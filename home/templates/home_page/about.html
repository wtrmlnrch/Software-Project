              <h2>What is ThinkEat?</h2>
              <p>
                  At ThinkEat, we empower individuals to transform their available 
                  ingredients into delicious, easy-to-follow recipes using OpenAI's 
                  ChatGPT models. Our mission is to help people make the most of the 
                  food they have, reducing waste and promoting sustainable consumption.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Food waste in America is a significant issue, with approximately 38% 
                  of all food going unsold or uneaten each year, equating to 
                  92 billion pounds of waste. By providing personalized recipes based 
                  on the ingredients you already have, ThinkEat aims to reduce food waste 
                  and help you save money. Join us in creating a more sustainable approach 
                  to cooking and dining.
