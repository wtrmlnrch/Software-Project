    <h2>What is ThinkEat?</h2>
    <p>At ThinkEat, we empower individuals to transform their available 
      ingredients into delicious, easy-to-follow recipes using OpenAI's 
      ChatGPT models. Our mission is to help people make the most of the 
      food they have, reducing waste and promoting sustainable consumption. 
      Food waste in America is a significant issue, with approximately 38% 
      of all food in America going unsold or uneaten each year, equating to 
      92 billion pounds of waste. Additionally, Americans spend an average 
      of $166 per month per person on dining out. Costs like that add up very 
      quickly. By providing personalized recipes based on the ingredients you 
      already have, ThinkEat aims to reduce food waste and help you save money. 
      Join us in creating a more sustainable and cost-effective approach to 
      cooking and dining.
